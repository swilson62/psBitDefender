# Program Name: PS BitDefender
 
PS BitDefender is an application that initiates a list of all BitDefender Gravity Zone Antivirus tasks running on a Linux box. This list takes the form of the Linux `top` command, showing CPU and memory usage for all running processes. When signature updates occur, one or more of the running processes will be killed, and replaced. This application will then update the list appropriately.
